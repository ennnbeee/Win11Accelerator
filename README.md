## ‚èØ Usage

Download the `Win11Accelerator.ps1` script, and from the saved location in a standard or elevated PowerShell prompt run one of the following:

### üß™ Testing

Run the script to assign **Windows 11 24H2** Feature Update risk states to **extensionAttribute 11** with warning prompts in **whatIf** mode where no changes are made:

```powershell
.\Win11Accelerator.ps1 -featureUpdateBuild 24H2 -target device -extensionAttribute 11 -whatIf $true
```

### ‚öô General Usage

Run the script to assign **Windows 11 24H2** Feature Update risk states to **extensionAttribute 10** with warning prompts:

```powershell
.\Win11Accelerator.ps1 -featureUpdateBuild 24H2 -target device -extensionAttribute 10
```

### ‚öô Subsequent Usage

Following the initial run the script, you can suppress the warning prompts by running the script to assign **Windows 11 24H2** Feature Update risk states to **extensionAttribute 10** without warning prompts:

```powershell
.\Win11Accelerator.ps1 -featureUpdateBuild 24H2 -target device -extensionAttribute 10 -firstRun $false
```

### üõç Group Creation

If you want the script to create dynamic groups based on the extension attribute risk state, include the switch parameter `createGroups`:

```PowerShell
.\Win11Accelerator.ps1 -featureUpdateBuild 24H2 -target device -extensionAttribute 10 -createGroups $true
```

This will allow for groups to be created with a prefix of **Win11Acc-**, only if a group with the same name does not already exist.

### üñ• Feature Update Creation

If you want the script to create a Feature Update deployment and deploy it to the **low risk group**, use the `deployFeatureUpdate` parameter; the Feature Update will start **x** `days` from when the script has run, with a group interval of **x** `days`.

```PowerShell
.\Win11Accelerator.ps1 -featureUpdateBuild 24H2 -target device -extensionAttribute 10 -deployFeatureUpdate $true -days 7
```
